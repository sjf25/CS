Here lies all of the information/scripts that I will

are free to commit.


TO GET YOURSELF ON THE MAILING LIST
==

Get the email file on your computer - https://github.com/gsalazar98/CS/archive/master.zip (downloads the PDF too)

Extract the contents, then compile it on your computer, and follow instructions. 
The program takes input, so be sure to input what it asks for.

You can get the PDF of the book we're going to be using from here - https://github.com/gsalazar98/CS/blob/master/thinkapjava.pdf?raw=true

Otherwise, updates will go here over the course of the year.
